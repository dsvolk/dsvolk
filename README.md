*2023 - PRESENT*
- Created [OkGPT](https://t.me/ok_gpt_bot), an AI personal assistant messenger bot. It allows users to interact with the most advanced AI through voice and text while offering additional productivity features and integrations.
- Optimized the code to parallelize user queries' processing to increase the bot performance by magnitude.
- Integrated multiple APIs, including Telegram, OpenAI, Google, Redis, Amplitude, Datadog, and more.
- Supervised three team members and a few external collaborators.

### AI Engineer @ Generative Tech Startup (ChatGPT)
*2023 - 2023*
- Developed an MVP of an app to query enterprise data in natural language. Given access to a database and a question in natural language about the data, the app would output the answer as a plot or a small table.
- Engineered and fine-tuned the prompts to improve the quality and correctness of SQL code generation.
- Created an automatic annotator for the database columns and the final table.

### Senior Machine Learning Engineer @ Blockchain Security Company
*2023 - 2023*
- Created a machine learning model to automatically detect malicious smart contracts before they can cause harm.
- Built a visualization tool for model output to audit its decisions.
- Set up automatic model deployment to AWS cloud platform as a Lambda serverless function.

### Senior Data Scientist and Data Engineer @ Israel-based HR Tech Startup
*2021 - 2022*
- Architected and directed the creation of a core Similarity engine to score candidates.
- Used pre-trained NLP deep neural networks to create semantic text embeddings, which significantly increased the Similarity engine output results.
- Created a Big Data pipeline in Databricks and Spark to enrich the input data and prepare the features for ML.
- Prepared custom deep learning models to build richer embeddings, including various data sources and metadata.

### Senior Data Scientist and Data Engineer @ US-based Ops/Tech Startup
*2020 - 2021*
- Built a foundational end-to-end machine learning solution that predicts fair prices of real-estate properties, thus eliminating a need for manual assessment and enabling the company to run its business by providing quick responses to its customers.
- Designed and implemented an automatically refreshing ETL pipeline that injects, cleans, joins, and enriches new data from AWS S3 storage daily.
- Developed an interpretable machine learning model with Scikit-learn, CatBoost, Lifelines, FBProphet, FAISS, and SHAP that consists of several submodels and satisfies business monotonicity constraints.
- Supervised other data science team members and coordinated with the engineering team.

### Researcher and Software Engineer @ Artec Group ![badge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isocpp/logos/master/cpp_logo.svg)
*2004 - 2007*
- Designed and implemented biometric machine learning face recognition algorithms.
- Created and implemented statistical test procedures for new recognition algorithms.
- Developed calibration procedures from 3D laser and flash scanners.
