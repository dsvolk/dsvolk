### Denis Volk, PhD
- [Full-stack AI engineer and data scientist](https://www.toptal.com/resume/denis-volk/BDnARp/worlds-top-talent) @ [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/)
- Associate Professor @ Interdisciplinary Scientific Center J.-V. Poncelet (CNRS UMI 2615)

I am a senior full-stack AI engineer and data scientist, highly skilled in modern generative tech (GPT-4, Midjourney, etc.), machine learning, ETL pipelines, data analysis, mathematical modeling, big data, and MLOps. I got my a Ph.D. in mathematics, and his data science expertise includes probabilistic risk modeling, revenue forecasting, geospatial data analysis, handwriting recognition, anomaly detection in time series, data engineering, and team leading.
